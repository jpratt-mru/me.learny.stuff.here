## Links in MD

``` markdown

- <http://foo.com> makes a link nice and easy
- [foo.you](http://link "you can add a title tag")
- [label][token] put [token]: url  at the bottom of the doc and you're laughing

```

## Images in MD

``` markdown

- ![alt text](link to image "you can add tooltip text here too")
- ![alt text][token]  put token downstairs like with links
- [![alt text](some thumbnail url)](the link to the big image) 
  lets you do a clickable thumbnail to larger image

```
